# clicktail

`clicktail` is [Altinity](https://altinity.com)'s agent for ingesting log file data into ClickHouse and making it available for exploration. Its favorite format is **JSON**, but understands how to parse a range of other well-known log formats.

`clicktail` is based on `honeytail` tool see [here](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeytail) and [its documentation](https://honeycomb.io/docs/send-data/agent/)

## Supported Parsers

`clicktail` supports reading files from `STDIN` as well as from a file on disk.

Our complete list of parsers can be found in the [`parsers/` directory](parsers/), but as of this writing, `clicktail` will support parsing logs generated by:

- [ArangoDB](parsers/arangodb/)
- [MongoDB](parsers/mongodb/)
- [MySQL](parsers/mysql/)
- [PostgreSQL](parsers/postgresql/)
- [nginx](parsers/nginx/)
- [regex](parsers/regex/)

## Installation

Install from `deb` package:

```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/Altinity/clickhouse/script.deb.sh | bash
```
if you want to force `os` and `dist` of your system, use the following command:

```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/Altinity/clickhouse/script.deb.sh | os=ubuntu dist=xenial bash
```

Install from source:

```
go get github.com/Altinity/clicktail
```

to install to a specific path:

```
GOPATH=/usr/local go get github.com/Altinity/clicktail
```

the binary will install to `/usr/local/bin/clicktail`

## Configuration

Use `clicktail.conf` file to manage options. There are section of the file called `Required Options` which should be set in the first place.

#### Config Example

`/etc/clicktail/clicktail.conf`
```
[Required Options]
ParserName = mysql
LogFiles = /var/log/mysql/mariadb-slow.log
Dataset = clicktail.mysql_slow_log
```

## Usage

Make sure ClickHouse server has proper schema created. See `schema` folder for `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE` statements.

Or do the following:

Create DB:
```
cat schema/db.sql | clickhouse-client --multiline
```

Create Table for MySQL slow logs:
```
cat schema/mysql.sql | clickhouse-client --multiline
```

Once schema is prepared you can use for MySQL:
```
clicktail --dataset='clicktail.mysql_slow_log' --parser=mysql --file=/var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
```

Or for Nginx:

```
clicktail -p nginx -f /var/log/nginx/access.log -d clicktail.nginx_log --nginx.conf=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --nginx.format=combined
```

## ClickHouse Setup

Clicktail is required ClickHouse to be accessible as a target server. So you should have ClickHouse server installed.

Follow these steps in order to install ClickHouse server and make it work with Clicktail.

Once you installed Clickhouse you whould probably need it to be open to outside connections. In order to do so update `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml` to add the following line:

`<listen_host>0.0.0.0</listen_host>`

just after: `<listen_host>127.0.0.1</listen_host>`

Also make sure ClickHouse port (which is `8123` by default) is open with your firewall.
